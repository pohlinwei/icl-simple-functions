# NOTE: It's important to use Python 3.8 because higher versions result in
# many dependency installation issues.

# Because `transformers` require `tokenizers` and higher versions of it
# depends on `puccinialin` which isn't available in Python 3.8 (only >= 3.9).
# See https://pypi.org/pypi/transformers/4.17.0/json for requirements.
